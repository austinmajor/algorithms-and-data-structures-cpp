CS 400 Assignment 2: applying ArrayList
In this assignment, you are going to build a program that can help rental car companies to manage their rental fleet.

Requirement:
- build ArrayList class as container.
- build Car class/structure to represent car objects.
- An ArrayList object is to hold Car objects.

Car class should have following fields:
- id (int)
- make (string)
- model (string)
- color (string)

Instructions:
- make up 15 cars and save them into a file: cars.data
- load these cars' info from the file, initialize 15 Car objects, place them into the Arraylist
- if new cars are added by user, they should be appended to the cars.data file when exiting the program
- design a menu based user interface that allows following operations:
-- search by id
-- search by make
-- search by model
-- search by color
-- add a new car (new car id cannot be same as existing ones)
-- delete an existing car by id
-- list all cars
-- exit the program

Grading:
- compilable and meaningful attemps: 30 points.
- functionality: 60 points (ArrayList 10p, Car 10p, file io 10p, menu functions 30p)
- comments and indentation: 10 points.

Submission:
- submit related .h files, .cpp files and cars.data via blackboard. Do not forget to submit cars.data!
