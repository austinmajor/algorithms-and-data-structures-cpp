CS 400 Assignment 5
Recursive/Backtracking: Generating Permutations

Description:
Mimic the code for N-queen problem (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/23recursion/Queens.java.html),
develop a program that generates all permutations for the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
The output should contain all 5! = 120 permutations.

Output Sample:
P#1: 1 2 3 4 5
P#2: 1 2 3 5 4
P#3: 1 2 4 3 5
...
P#120: 5 4 3 2 1

Hint:
- Thoroughly study the N-queen problem first.
- The code for N-queen is very close to the code generating permutations, just some helper functions away.
- Keep the structure of the enumerate() function. You may change the function head to take in the array size.
- Implement printPermutation() function and use it to replace printQueens().
- Implement isConsistent() function for permutation check. This check should be easier than N-queen consistent check.

File_name:
- permutation.cpp

Grading:
- compilable and meaningful attemps: 20 points.
- structure of enumerate(): 30 points
- helper functions: 40 points.
- comments, file names and indentation: 10 points.
