CS 400 Assignment 6
Round Robin Simulation

Description:
Write a program that utilizes STL queue (or your own queue implementation) that simulates the round robin process scheduling algorithm.

Requirement:
- write a class Process that holds following integer information: id, arrival_time, time_needed, finished_time.
- read and initiate 5 Process objects from associated file (round_robin.txt)
- file format: id, arrival_time, time_needed
- once a process is finished, mark its finished_time accordingly.
- CPU time frame: 4.
- utilize a queue for process scheduling.
- store finished processes into a vector (first finished, first stored)
- output: print information about finished processes from the vector, in the finished order.

File_name:
- round_robin.cpp
- You may use extra source files for class Process.

Grading:
- compilable and meaningful attemps: 20 points.
- class Process: 10 points.
- round robin simulation and usage of queue: 60 points.
- comments, file names and indentation: 10 points.
