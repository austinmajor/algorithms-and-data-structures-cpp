CS 400 Fall 2019 Midterm Review Guide
Algorithms:
- Insertion sort
- Binary search
Time complexity:
- Big oh for every non-recursive function, especially for data structure functions.
Data structures:
- ArrayList:
o Study the source code well. Header file will be given so expect to implement member
functions.
- Linked List:
o Study the source code well. Lean how to maintain the head pointer of a linked list, how
to traverse(), add_at_tail() and delete().
- Stack implementation:
o Implement stack based on ArrayList.
o Implement stack based on STL list (linked list.)
- Stack applications:
o decimal number to binary number conversion,
o parentheses matching
o Palindrome string checker
o Postfix expression evaluation (hw 4)
o Infix to postfix conversion (lab 5)
- Backtracking:
o N-queen problem
o Permutation generator (hw 5)
