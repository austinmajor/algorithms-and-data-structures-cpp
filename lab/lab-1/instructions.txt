CS 400 Lab 1

Implement a class named DynamicArray that has following members: 
•	A pointer to hold a dynamically allocated array, of type int. 
•	A member variable to hold the size of the array. 
•	A default constructor, which will allocate an array of size 10
•	A parameterized constructor, which takes a size and use the size to allocate array. 
•	A copy constructor, which performs deep copy. 
•	A copy assignment operator, which performs deep copy and supports self-assignment of the form x = x. See reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4172722/what-is-the-rule-of-three 
•	A destructor that recycles allocated memory
•	A member function that fills array with random numbers.
•	A member function that prints all elements from the array. 
•	A member function that performs insertion sort.
