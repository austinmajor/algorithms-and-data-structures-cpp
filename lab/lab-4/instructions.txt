Implement a class for doubly linked list. Your doubly linked list should have following members:
- A head pointer
- A tail pointer
- Function: insert at head
- Function: insert at tail
- Function: delete a node
- Function: search a node
- Function: traverse
- Function: reverse traverse
Test your implementation by calling member functions inside main.
